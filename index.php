		<p>
			This is my little place where I put my stories and other things that
			 it is better to host online in a single place rather than sharing
			 them as individual files.

			I've been a hobbyist web developer since I was about 10, and, through
			 a <em>lot</em> of practice, I'm confident enough to call myself at
			 least competent at web development! Hooray! My main focus of web dev
			 is accessibility, a thing far too many others let fall to the wayside.
			 Because of this, I do offer to help people with making their websites
			 more accessible should they so desire, so please do contact me if you
			 are interested!

			I tend to limit my social media due to privacy concerns, however, I
			 <em>do</em> have <a href='https://www.twitter.com/laurenauramgold'>
			 a twitter account</a> if you wish to take a look at that, as well
			 as a <a href='https://github.com/auramgold'>Github</a>, where 
			 the source code for this site is hosted.
