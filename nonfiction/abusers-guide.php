The Abuser's Guide to Transmisogyny
<div class="subtitle">aka &quot;How to Cancel a Trans Girl&quot;</div>
</h1>

<h2>Selecting a Victim</h2>

<p>Most aspiring transmisogynistic harassers will seek out the art due to a
particular trans girl in mind who annoys them in some way. Maybe she
started acting Weird, maybe you're just vehemently against her
holding any power over you, maybe she just disagreed with you on a
ship. Whatever your reasoning is, it does not matter much to your
attempts at life destruction beyond what talking points you can farm
out of your grudge. If, however, you are the sort of amoral sadist
who would seek to destroy a trans girl's life without even the remote
justification of a petty grudge purely out of some fucked up sense of
power, then it would do well to select a victim that will be more
vulnerable to your attempts.</p>

<p>With a deft manipulative hand, these tactics can work against most any
trans girl you'd seek to upend, however, those who have past
experience with attempts against them will be better equipped to
handle your attacks. It's best to seek a victim who is ignorant of
the modes of transmisogyny, especially
if you are specifically attacking her in a <em>space</em>
that has no past experience repelling similar attempts. The number
one way a victim might be able to fight back against your attempts to
slander her is knowing the true intentions and methods of what you
are doing to her, and you cannot let this be common knowledge if you
want success in your endeavors.</p>

<p>Multiply-marginalized trans girls are <em>especially</em>
potent victims, as people are primed to cast away those further from
the societal &quot;norm&quot; of experience, which trans girls are
inherently already far beyond. For example, a neurodivergent trans
girl in one way or another is a <em>perfect</em>
victim, especially if her neurodivergences manifest in a way that
makes her ambiguously Weird. Many communities are always <em>itching</em>
at the chance to shove away their weirdest members, and you can levy
this to your abuse's advantage with very little effort if you pick
your victims carefully. The cluster B types are especially vulnerable
to this, as if your victim has ever lashed out or split on someone,
you can lean into people's preconceived ideas of &quot;narcissists&quot;
or &quot;anti-social&quot; people being Inherently Evil to layer on
even <em>more</em> attacks on
your victim.</p>

<p>Consider also picking a trans girl you can double up on lightly-disguised
racist tirades against, as with only the <em>barest</em>
veiling most people are willing to jump on racial minorities seen as
&quot;uppity&quot; faster than you can blink, doubly so for the trans
girls that are your victims. In more physical communities, you can
leverage disability to <em>terrifying</em>
effect with your amoral tirades. Sprinkle on implications of your
victim being a &quot;burden&quot; in some way or another, and you can
get people to cast her aside without even having to step foot into
the more difficult lanes of attack.</p>

<p>But even for a &quot;less marginalized&quot; trans girl, while it might
take some more work, you can turn the very same mechanisms you'd use
against multiply-marginalized victims as excuses for your less
marginalized victims. Don't worry about the hypocrisy, you're here to
destroy an innocent victim's life, you threw that morality out the
window as soon as you started.
It takes some more searching, but if you can just find something to
take out of context to frame your victim as exactly the same kind of
bigot that you're willing to be, she can be an even <em>easier</em>
victim than the ones mentioned before, as you can borrow a page from
the fascist playbook and turn the language of social justice against
the very people it was created to aid. Hell, working to frame your
<em>victim</em> as enacting the
very same transmisogyny you're trying to ruin <em>her</em>
life with is one of the most effective approaches, as you can get the
very beings who might protect her on your side if you play your cards
right.</p>

<h2>Mode of Attack</h2>

<p>At this point, you've decided on your victim and are actively trying to figure out how to start. The
first step is merely to have patience. If you want to actually make
your life destruction <em>stick</em>, you need to wait for the right
moment to strike the iron. If you don't have what it takes to be able
to wait her out without your conscience getting to you, you don't
have what it takes to destroy a life.</p>

<p>Secondly, of course, you need to decide on a mode of attack, the two major categories of which I'd
classify as &quot;Flash Flare&quot; and &quot;Slow Burn.&quot; This
decision must be made early and, critically, <em>must</em> be stuck to.
Backing off on one and flip-flopping in the middle can kill your
legitimacy at attempts of <em>either</em>. It can very clearly reveal
your hand beyond the veil of &quot;just asking questions&quot; if you
cannot stick to a specific plan, and can drive the allies you <em>need</em>
on your side away if they start to realize that they're the baddies.</p>

<h3>Flash Flare / Callout Post</h3>

<p>For the aspiring abuser who has less confidence in their own patience, a hard, fast strike out of the
blue is probably the best course of action. This method, too,
benefits from patience, but that certainly doesn't mean it can't be
attempted at any time, just that it may be far easier if you wait for
a perfect moment to strike.</p>

<p>The main factor of going for a fast and hard strike is finding some Controversial point to grow a
harassment mob around. Maybe your victim said something you can
ship-of-Theseus into sounding racist, maybe she chose to associate
with someone already considered &quot;problematic&quot;, maybe she
even just posted about some sort of kink or sexuality and you're
gonna bend that into her being a rapist or a pedophile. The last
approach works best of all of these, as society is always primed to
see trans girls as pedophiles; the TERFs already did the work for you
on that front. But even if any sexual allegations aren't your
centerpiece seed, they can do <em>wonders</em> as an extra spice, a
perfect excuse for &quot;if you support my victim against me, you're
supporting pedophilia&quot; attacks.</p>

<p>Of course, pedophilia isn't the only thing you can kill a trans girl with by the accusation, you can
take special advantage of people being extra willing to attribute <em>any</em>
wrongdoing to a trans girl. She made a comment against prisons once?
You can frame her as a fascist sympathizer based on &quot;but the
fascists should go too!&quot; and <em>no one will check</em>! You don't
even have to have any vague remote excuse, just making 'evidence' up
for your crusade is a beautiful way to stack on the hatred, and
pulling accusations from every category helps solidify your
accusation of your victim as Inherently Sinful, like society already
primes everyone to want to do to any trans girl they see. That last
point is one of the most crucial here, if you want this to stick,
leaning into christian sin culture helps a lot, as framing your
victim as &quot;unclean&quot; in some way or another is a perfect way
to isolate her.</p>

<p>Regardless, once you find some seed, composed of as many vaguely Controversial things as you can
find or create, now is time for the actual strike. As mentioned, this
does well to have patience on, as a more <em>recent</em> bout of
Controversy around your victim will make people less suspicious of
your motives. You can certainly drop the callout post bomb on her at
any point, but if you do it at any random time, it is far easier for
your victim to call attention to &quot;why are you drudging up past
grudges out of the blue&quot;. This is, of course, <em>exactly</em>
what you are doing, and you do not, under any circumstances, want
people to realize that.</p>

<p>Once you have dropped this callout post bomb, you do, of course, have to defend it. Transmisogyny is a
powerful force to pull upon, but it usually isn't easy enough to just
do only <em>one</em> attack. For one, try and get yourself a couple
allies who are willing to amplify your attacks. They need not
actually know your more sinister intentions, arguably they're even
<em>more</em> effective if they think they're doing actual justice. One
way to try to get allies on your side is to encourage everyone near
your victim to abandon her, lest they be just as &quot;problematic&quot;
as you've claimed she is. If your victim is in some relative position
of power (say a moderator role or even mild informal social
influence), you can also try and build up a martyr narrative of her
being the <em>real</em> attacker here. Make appeals to some &quot;silent
majority&quot; that supports you and are oppressed by your victim, no
matter how fake or nonexistent any &quot;silent support&quot; may be.
No matter what resistance any of your victim's support network gives,
stick to it ardently, build up a whole small <em>movement</em> if you
can. Hell, try and get a harassment forum to join you if you're
<em>really</em> confident.</p>

<p>Of course, most importantly of all is to stick to it, lest you compromise your own credibility even
further. No matter what consequences this has on your own network, no
matter any quibbles your conscience may have about hurting people, no
matter how evil you feel, if you want to destroy your victim's life,
you have to stick to it to the end. Don't give up the fight, don't
give up the attack, until you've either won and she's been driven out
to probably kill herself from your actions, or until you've been
driven out instead for your harassment. You weren't ever going to be
able to do your intended life destruction without putting your social
standing somewhat at risk, so that's the consequences of failure, and
cutting your losses will make you even <em>less</em> trustworthy if you
make any future attempts.</p>

<h3>Slow Burn / Whisper Networks</h3>

<p>Of course, if you have a lot <em>more</em> patience, and don't mind it taking a while to <em>truly</em> destroy
your victim's life, taking a slower approach puts you personally at
far less risk and can be far <em>more</em> effective. While attacking
her in the long term from the shadows, you can push a lot more subtle
and sinister points against your victim without having as much
potential for her to push back against you.</p>

<p>The most important thing to focus on with a slow burn approach is knowing that you <em>cannot pull it
off alone</em>. Assembling a whisper network is required, as without a
group of collaborators, a single person spreading rumors barely has
legitimacy, even for the vulnerability of trans girls. The
recruitment for this is necessarily a slow process, one that requires
waiting for opportunities. Perhaps someone you see has suddenly
picked up a grudge against your victim and you can pull them in with
your own ammo to turning that into full-blown hatred. Disgruntled
ex-partners of your victim are brilliant for this, as it's very easy
to convince them that &quot;we weren't good partners for each other&quot;
is the same thing as &quot;she is inherently abusive and I need to
get rid of her.&quot; Play up the pain of your allies-in-recruitment,
no matter how petty, and try and direct it towards desiring harm of
your victim.</p>

<p>Of course, your allies don't <em>just</em> have to be those with personal grudges. Many communities have
self-ascribed &quot;anti-pedophile crusaders,&quot; and these are a
<em>valuable</em> resource considering how easy it is to make someone
see a trans girl as a sex criminal. Recruit them by leaning into a
narrative of how your victim &quot;protects pedophiles in
&lt;community&gt;,&quot; which works <em>especially</em> well in fandom
spaces with the presence of their &quot;anti&quot; faction. If you
construct a narrative of your victim puppeting the community from
behind the scenes, you can lean right into the fascist playbook of
portraying your vulnerable victim as the puppetmaster.</p>

<p>Assembling your allies together is a slow process, but as you do that, it gives you more power to levy
stronger influence. You can, for one, subtly encourage your allies to
slowly push away your victim, start slowly excluding her. Trans girl
victims are often very liable to blame themselves if people are
driven away from them, so if you play your cards right, your victim
won't even notice if people slowly start abandoning her on your or
your allies' urging. In order to get this sort of thing to stick,
it's important to lean into the &quot;just asking questions&quot;
nature, to hide the full extent of what you're doing. You're not
&quot;smearing a trans girl as a pedophile&quot;, you're Just Asking
Questions about the &quot;Problematic&quot; things she's up to. The
fascists often speak of &quot;hiding their power level&quot; in their
rhetoric, in order to convince people who might not be as on board
with the <em>open</em> evil, and you'd be wise to take their lead to
keep allies who might think they're still doing justice on your side.</p>

<p>Of course, if someone <em>else</em> ends up attempting some sort of callout post against your victim
independent of your little whisper network of attack, which for a
more famous trans girl is more likely than you'd think, you can
incorporate this into your attacks. Be just one more person signal
boosting the claims, subtly levy your already long-prepared whisper
network to lean into &quot;she was already Problematic, and now she
does this? why are you still friends with her,&quot; but don't <em>fully</em>
lean into the flash flare at the cost of your whisper network. If the
callout post fails, you want to still have a whisper network
maintained even with your open attacks on your victim, now armed with
new ammo of whatever was drudged up for you by someone else.</p>

<p>A whisper network is very much the long game, and it can take <em>years</em>
for it to see full effect, but the way it can make your life
destruction <em>stick</em>
is unmatched. Slowly isolating your victim from any support and
slowly convincing those around her to drop her as a friend tends to
stick far harder after you let your maintenance fade. After all,
someone who abandoned your victim in a flash flare of passion at the
callout calling her Evil might repair it, but someone who you've
caused to naturally drift away from your victim might never <em>want</em>
to repair it. Your isolation can be complete if you play the long
game, and likely drive your victim to take her own life from the
loneliness, at very little risk to yourself.</p>

<h2>Ammunition and Justification</h2>

<p>Now that you've decided on how exactly you're going to go about destroying your victim's life and
likely driving her to suicide, you have to actually collect your
ammunition to put your plan into action. No matter if you're going
for a slow-burn or a quick huge callout post, you have to actually
have justification for your irrational hatred of your victim, or else
no one else is going to go along with you easily. It certainly does
not have to be <em>true</em>, but it definitely functions better if you
can ground it in something people are willing to believe.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, society already has everyone you're going to try and recruit primed to view
trans girls as sexual abusers in hiding, so accusations of sex crimes
will function perfectly to discredit your victim. You'd do well to
find some seed you can frame into an allegation of sexual assault or
grooming to start with, as that is going to be the easiest one to get
going. Perhaps your victim has a disgruntled ex who you can convince
of their false victimhood, or perhaps your victim once talked to a
minor who you can convince that they were groomed. However it is,
while it <em>helps</em> to have a supposed &quot;victim&quot; of your
victim to justify your attacks, you certainly don't <em>need</em>
someone real. A vague &quot;multiple people have told me she abused
them&quot; can go a long way, as the vagueness makes it nigh
impossible to fact check, and casts doubt on anything your victim
says against your attacks, as you can frame her own retaliation as
abuse <em>itself</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you don't even need even a <em>made-up</em> &quot;victim&quot; to accuse your trans girl
victim of sexual impropriety. If your victim is into any sexuality at
all, she's likely to have some kink or another that is vaguely
Controversial enough to accuse her on. Never mind that it's between
consenting adults, if you frame it as <em>thoughtcrime</em>, if you
frame it as <em>sin</em>, it's very difficult for your victim to
actually defend against it. One particularly effective mode to attack
with is any caregiver/little dynamics your victim might be into, as
it is very easy to twist &quot;your victim likes diapers&quot; into
&quot;your victim likes fucking children&quot; as a ship-of-Theseus
argument. Targeting littleness works especially well because it is a
kink that usually comes from parental abuse that manifests into fawn
trauma, and you can take advantage of your victim's trauma making her
try to appease anyone that hurts her to neutralize any ability she
has to fight back.</p>

<p>While littleness is one of the <em>best</em> targets to base accusations of sexual abuse on, basically
<em>any</em> kink can work well enough for that. If she draws CNC you
can call her a &quot;secret rapist,&quot; if she's into petplay you
can call her a &quot;zoophile&quot;, if she's into gore or
sadomasochism you can claim she's physically abusive. Hell, you can
get the antis on your side if she merely ships the wrong characters
together or like a "bad" character, as they're all too willing to join at the <em>hint</em> of
anything like that they can attack someone for. Literally any kink or
sexuality can be twisted into a slight against your victim, and this
works very well for your attacks so that they may pull at the
groundwork the fascists already set out for you.</p>

<p>Of course, while attacking your victim's sexuality might be almost the perfect platter of ability to
attack, there's many, <em>many</em> other modes of attack you can take.
For example, if your victim picked up some new religion of some
variety, something she's excited for and found very important, it is
<em>trivial</em> to frame her as an abusive cultist for enthusing about
it. Remember from before, communities are usually itching to get rid
of their ambiguously Weirdest members, and &quot;she's an abusive
cultist trying to convert you&quot; puts words to any subtle ableist
discomforts they might already have with your victim's
neurodivergences.</p>

<p>Maybe your victim made some bad political take at some point, or at least something that can be
twisted <em>into</em> a bad take. Lean into the bad-faith readings,
frame anything that isn't explicitly including everyone as inherently
racist somehow. People are always itching for some excuse to see a
white trans girl as basically the same as a white cis man, lean into
that by degendering your references, call her &quot;they/them&quot;
no matter her pronoun preferences. If you can take away the immediate
perception of your victim as a trans girl, you can hide the blatant
transphobia of your attacks in the padding of the language. If your
victim is white, emphasize that, call her inherently racist, lean
into any little thing that can be framed in bad faith as not being
good enough.</p>

<p>Of course, this all applies reciprocally for if you are attempting a transmisogynoir against a
POC trans girl. You can lean into racist caricatures about violence,
as people are always <em>very</em> willing to see someone they can
consider as a black man as a feral violent murderer waiting to
happen. Mix in transphobic anxieties about &quot;invading women's
spaces,&quot; and you can double up on the accusations of sexual
impropriety from before, as people are even <em>more</em> willing to
see a POC trans girl as a rapist on flimsy evidence.</p>

<p>Really, literally <em>anything</em> you can imagine <em>anyone</em> having any conceivable level of problem
with can be reframed into your victim having committed some
unforgivable sin only solvable by exile. Get creative, try different
modes of attack depending on what communities you are attacking your
victim is in, learn from what has or hasn't worked in the past (which
is, of course, another benefit of a slow-burn approach). If you lean
into it enough, anything can work for your desired life destruction,
as people are <em>itching</em> to get rid of trans girls in the first
place, and at its core, you can tap into that with <em>anything</em>.</p>

<h2>Failure Modes</h2>

<p>Now, of course, the level of complete life destruction you are attempting is absolutely <em>not</em>
without risks, and there are many common failure modes your attempts
on your victim's life might fall into. Especially notable is your
attempts backfiring and getting <em>you</em> purged from community
instead, which is a risk you have to account for if you really want
to go for your attacks. No matter what, this is your doing, this is
what you signed on for when you started going after your victim, and
flailing around in your loss is likely to make you look more pathetic
to any other communities you might try and move to attack after your
failure.</p>

<p>The most obvious risk is your victim catching wind of your blatant attempts at destroying her life,
and warning those around her not to trust you. This can be <em>supremely</em>
difficult to evade, which is why it was strongly suggested to try and
choose a victim who is less aware of the modes of transmisogyny you
are using to attack her. With a deft hand and a slow burn approach,
you can still manage it, as people are more likely to be wary of a
callout post than a Just Asking Questions whisper network, but if you
play your cards wrong, it is <em>very</em> likely to backfire and
attack your attempts specifically, even bolstering your victim in the
process and making it harder for any others (or you under a new
alias) to come in and try again.</p>

<p>The other failure mode, and one that is less obvious from the outset, is your set of collaborators
collapsing into infighting. Those who think they are doing actual
justice rather than merely destroying an innocent victim's life are
very primed to jump at shadows, and any of your allies doing
something they consider Problematic is liable to have your group
collapse under internally-targeted callouts. This can be avoided by
trying to prevent your collaborators from getting close enough to
<em>notice</em> anything they might be upset by, in the same mode as an
abusive cult preventing its victims from comparing notes. However,
this kind of thing can overall be <em>supremely</em> hard to prevent if
you're not strongly careful, and I'd strongly recommend caution and
adaptability to any specific circumstances accordingly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you've followed these steps well and wielded your own charisma against a trans girl, you have
probably succeeded in your life destruction! Your victim is probably
homeless, dead, or both, completely shredded from community by your
harassment campaign to get rid of someone you're scared of for no
other reason than her being an Uppity minority who you didn't like
being around you! Good job! I hope you're proud of yourself! Time to
move onto the next victim, as at this point, I suspect you have a
taste for the blood of the innocent, for which you can start this
guide again and repeat ad nauseam until you get bored or exhaust your
credibility.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you destroyed an innocent life! Well done! I hope you're happy with yourself.</p>
